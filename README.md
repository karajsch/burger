## Project Description

Eat-Da-Burger is a burger logging app powered by MySQL, Node, Express, and Handlebars! Burgers appear in the left area from you to choose from, or you can add as many new burgers as you want by typing your perfect burger in the text area then clicking the "add burger" button. Click the "devour it!" button to devour it, then it will be logged in the right area. This application uses Node and MySQL to query and route data while Handlebars generates the HTML. All burgers will be saved on a database on a server, whether eaten or not.

## Installation
You can go to the live deployed link at [mighty-sea-25322.herokuapp.com](https://mighty-sea-25322.herokuapp.com/) and start adding burgers right away! Or if you prefer to run this application locally, please clone the Git repo, install all dependencies, and run `node server.js` and you can find the application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
